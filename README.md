# nob.py

The great Header-only build tool [[nob.h](https://github.com/Tsoding/nob.h)] in Python

### TODO

- Well... Implement the whole thing in Python ofc! Meaning it's not a wrapper for a .dll, .lib, .so, or anything.
- This means everthing including Dynamic Arrays.
- it must compile on ALL operating systems (Windows, Linux and OSX).
- Figure out how to interface to libc to access malloc, realloc and so on.

This project will focus on the Windows build then it will continue onto Linux and OSX will just have work, cause i don't have a MacBook... maybe people will comfirm it works, idk.

# Platforms

- Version 24H2 (OS Build 26100.4652)

Linux:
- WSL installed with Debian (TODO!)

- Whatever is the latest (can't keep track)
